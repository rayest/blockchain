# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```


## Chainlink VRF
* network
> 1. Every network has a unique key hash 、fee、coordinator、link token address. They are used to interact with the chainlink VRF service and should be set in the smart contract
* subscription
> 1. This is used to subscribe to the chainlink VRF service, should be fund with LINK token or ETH to pay for the service
> 2. every subscription has more than one consumer which is the smart contract that will be using the random number generated by the VRF  
* consumer
> 1. This is the smart contract that will be using the random number generated by the VRF. When the contract is deployed, it(the contract address) should be registered with the subscription manually or automatically

* VRF2 Vs VRF2.5
> 1. The hash key is different and the VRF2.5 is more secure
> 2. The hash key of VRF2.5 can not be used with VRF2  

## steps
1. create a chainlink VRF subscription on the dashboard: to get subscription id
2. deploy the VRFConsumer contract with subscript id: to get contract address as consumer
3. register the consumer with the subscription: to get request id
4. call requestRandomWords with false: to get request id and pay with LINK
5. call getRequestStatus with request id: to get the random number list

## chainlink functions
1. Code contract and deploy `GettingStartedFunctionsConsumer.sol`
2. Create Functions Subscription With Sepolia Token and get subscription id
3. Add consumer to subscription. And the address of the consumer is the address of the contract deployed in step 1
